**15 Years, One City, Two Empires: MU 2008 vs. MC 2023 — Which Peak Is Untouchable?**

Have you ever wondered: **Why does Manchester City dominate the Premier League, while Manchester United has struggled in recent years?** Trophies and league positions are just the surface — the real story is revealed in this analysis.

This article uses **Premier League match data** to compare the performance of Manchester United (MU) and Manchester City (MC). When placing MU’s and MC’s metrics side by side, the differences are not only about performance level, but also about **trends, stability, and how success is accumulated over time**.
The comparison focuses on two representative peak periods: **2007–2008 for MU** and **2022–2023 for MC**.

## POINTS PER MATCH (PPM)

The PPM chart tells two contrasting stories.

**MU:**
A sharp, short-lived peak followed by fluctuations and decline, with strong season-to-season volatility. MU’s performance was not sustainably maintained; each season appears fragmented rather than part of a stable long-term trajectory.

**MC:**
In contrast, MC starts at a lower level, but its PPM gradually increases and stabilizes over time. After crossing the 2.0 threshold, MC maintains a high-performance baseline across multiple consecutive seasons — evolving from a mid-table team into a title contender with a prolonged peak period.

## CUMULATIVE POINTS

The cumulative points chart further clarifies the difference in momentum.

**MU:**
Points accumulate relatively evenly within each season, but without clear acceleration. MU maintains a certain level of competitiveness, yet lacks long enough breakthrough phases to establish a dominant advantage.

**MC:**
Shows a steeper and more stable cumulative curve, especially in later stages. MC not only earns more points but does so at a faster and less interrupted pace.

---

## GOAL DIFFERENCE

The distribution of goal difference highlights disparities in the quality of victories.

**MU:**
Results cluster around narrow wins (1–2 goals), with a noticeable left tail representing relatively heavy defeats. This suggests that MU’s result margins were not tightly controlled.

**MC:**
The distribution is strongly right-skewed, with frequent emphatic wins (by 3, 4, 5 goals or more), reflecting superior match control and a tendency to overwhelm opponents when winning.

---

## STABILITY

Seasonal performance volatility further emphasizes the contrast.

**MU:**
Higher standard deviation indicates greater inconsistency. Good runs rarely last long, and downturns appear frequently.

**MC:**
Although MC also experiences accelerations and slowdowns, its overall standard deviation is lower. Performance is more stable, with fluctuations typically representing short-term adjustments rather than full trend reversals.

---

## ELO RATING

The Elo rating chart most clearly illustrates the reversal of status.

**MU:**
Starts at a high level but fluctuates heavily, with no sustained upward trend. Recoveries are usually brief and quickly neutralized.

**MC:**
Elo rating rises steadily over time, from an average level to a very high range, and remains there. This reflects a systematically built and well-preserved overall strength across seasons.

---

## HOME VS. AWAY POINTS PER MATCH

Both MU and MC earn more points at home than away. However:

**MU:**
Shows a larger gap between home and away performance, indicating a heavier reliance on home advantage.

**MC:**
Achieves higher point averages in both conditions, particularly demonstrating consistent ability to collect points away from home.

---

## CONCLUSION

The difference between Manchester United and Manchester City goes far beyond trophies or league positions in individual seasons — it lies in **long-term performance structure**.

Manchester United represents a model of **early peak followed by decline and volatility**, with performance heavily dependent on isolated seasons. Manchester City, on the other hand, demonstrates a **systematic upgrade process**: evolving from an average team to an elite one, and sustaining that level over an extended period.

From a data-driven perspective, Manchester City’s later dominance is not the result of a few explosive seasons, but the outcome of a **stable, continuous, and low-variance developmental trajectory**.
